### Shortly about myself:
My name is Egor Emelyanov, 19 years old. I'm studying second year student at BSUIR. I'm fond of front-end development for one and a half year. I like programming, because I have the freedom of actions and can create whatever comes to my mind. For me programming it is solving interesting tasks. I would like to work with interesting people and exchange knowledge with them.
